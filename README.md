# Piracy.net

Piracy.net is one of the first free open source TSE's (Torrent Search Engine's). The entire project is still under development as I will update it to make it not scrape 1337x.to anymore, and I'll add user managements.


# Important

Please do NOT upload this nowhere on google due to the legal terms of service violations from 1337x.to as I was scraping search results for test results, once I add torrent uploadings, you can go ahead and host the website. 

I am **not** responsible for anything you do with this as this is completly for educational purposes and to see how Torrent Search Engines work and how to make them.

All credits for torrents go to https://1337x.to.


## Features

- Scrapes torrent's for now.
- Added fun animation styles for some known users. 
- Clean design.



## Run Locally

First you need [XAMPP](#). After you've installed it, you can go to the XAMPP/htdocs, and delete all of the files. Now follow the steps:

Clone the project
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/snxiee/Piracy.net
```

Fix locations

```bash
  Place all of the files into `htdocs`
```

XAMPP

```bash
  Run XAMPP Control Panel
```

Start the servers

```bash
  Run apache, mysql and filezilla
```

Now open https://127.0.0.1
